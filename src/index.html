    I'm a grad student in Computer Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, 
    and I've spent a few years in the tech world before that. As a Full Stack Developer 
    at Infosys, I helped modernize a debt collection platform and built a self-service portal from 
    scratch that made things way easier for users.
   I also picked up some cool security skills by building a system to track user licenses,
    which cut down on support tickets by 60%. 
    My work at METY Tech also gave me the chance to build mobile apps from web applications, making them a lot faster. Overall, my goal is always to build things that are not just functional but also really improve the user experience.

    On the side, as a lead course assistant for a software design lab at UIUC, I got to mentor a bunch of student teams, 
    helping them with their projects and working with the professor to make the course better
